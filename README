This syntax file highlights the wikilinks and directives in IkiWiki files
(.mdwn)

Please note that this syntax definition only defines highlighting for directives
and wikilinks, *not* markdown files. To obtain proper highlighting of ikiwiki
files (markdown + wikilinks/directives), you must install the Markdown syntax
file (vimscript #1242).

You can also use this syntax definition if you use reST, by installing the reST
syntax file (vimscript #973), and putting the following in your .vimrc file:

    let g:ikiwiki_render_filetype = 'rest'

This step is not required for using markdown files.

This syntax file has a git repository; you can clone it with:

git clone http://git.devnull.li/ikiwiki-syntax.git
